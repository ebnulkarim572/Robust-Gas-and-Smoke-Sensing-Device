# Robust-Gas-and-Smoke-Sensing-Device
A hardware and software based prototype we called “Robust Gas and Smoke Sensing Device” (An open source project) made of combining “MQ-2 Gas Sensor Module”, “I2C Liquid Crystal Display”, “Arduino Uno Board” and “Arduino IDE Software”. It is suitable for sensing gaseous ecology of LPG, Smoke, Alcohol, Butane, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide concentrations anywhere in the air. When measuring gases like Carbon Monoxide, LPG, or methane, the term concentration is used to describe the amount of gas by volume in the air. In this prototype we used Parts-per-million (abbreviated ppm) is the ratio of one gas to another. For example, 1000ppm of CO means that if you could count a million gas molecules, 1000 of them would be of carbon monoxide and 999,000 molecules would be some other gases. By this prototype gaseous concentrations values (PPM) can be observed in our planet or other planets regarding “NASA gaseous ecological analysis index”. Here suitable standard gas sensing index for “MQ-2 Gas sensor” is (300-10000) PPM.
